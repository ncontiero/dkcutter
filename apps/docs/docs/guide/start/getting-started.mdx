Welcome to DKCutter! This guide will walk you through creating your first project from a template.

The recommended way to use DKCutter is via `npx`, `pnpm dlx`, `yarn dlx`, or `bunx`, which ensures you are always using the latest version.

<Steps>

### 1. Creating a New Project

Let's start by creating a new project. We'll use a simple, official template to get a feel for how `dkcutter` works.

Open your terminal and run the following command:

<PackageManagerTabs command="dkcutter@latest gh:ncontiero/dkcutter-nextjs" isExecuted />

This command tells DKCutter to download the [`dkcutter-nextjs`](https://github.com/ncontiero/dkcutter-nextjs) template from GitHub and start the project creation process.

### 2. Answering the Prompts

DKCutter will now ask you a series of questions to configure your new project. These are defined in the template's `dkcutter.json` file. For this example, you can accept the default values by pressing `Enter` for each prompt.

```bash
✔ What is the project name? … Next.js App
✔ What is the project slug? … next-js-app
✔ What is the project description? … A Next.js app generated with dkcutter
...
```

### 3. Exploring Your New Project

Once you've answered all the prompts, DKCutter will create a new directory with the `project_slug` you provided.

That's it! You've successfully created a new project using DKCutter. You can now `cd` into your new project directory and start working.

## Template Abbreviations

DKCutter understands abbreviations for popular Git providers. This makes it easier to use templates hosted on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

- `gh:` for GitHub (`gh:user/repo`)
- `gl:` for GitLab (`gl:user/repo`)
- `bb:` for Bitbucket (`bb:user/repo`)

You can also use the full URL to any Git repository:

<PackageManagerTabs command="dkcutter@latest https://github.com/ncontiero/dkcutter-nextjs.git" isExecuted />

## Other Ways to Use DKCutter

While using a GitHub template is common, you can also use templates from your local machine or even use DKCutter programmatically.

### From a Local Template

If you have a template on your local machine, you can point DKCutter to it. For example, if you have a template in a directory named `my-awesome-template` in your current folder:

<PackageManagerTabs command="dkcutter@latest ./my-awesome-template" isExecuted />

### Creating a Template with `--init`

You can bootstrap a new, empty template to create your own. This is a great way to get started with making your own templates.

<PackageManagerTabs command="dkcutter@latest --init" isExecuted />

> [!INFO]
> This feature is available in version `4.6.0` or later.

### Programmatic Usage

You can also use DKCutter as a module in your own JavaScript/TypeScript projects.

First, install it as a dependency:

<PackageManagerTabs command="install dkcutter" />

Then, you can import and use the `dkcutter` function:

```javascript title="my-script.js"
import { dkcutter } from "dkcutter";

async function main() {
  try {
    // Create a project from a GitHub template
    await dkcutter({ template: "gh:ncontiero/dkcutter-nextjs" });

    console.log("Project created successfully!");
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("An error occurred:", error);
  }
}

main();
```
